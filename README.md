Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm Clara Maria Ferracini â€“ a Data Scientist in training, currently pursuing my Master's in Big Data & Business Analytics at ESCP Business School. With a passion for turning data into actionable insights, my journey is driven by curiosity and innovation in AI, Machine Learning, and Predictive Analytics.

Iâ€™m fascinated by how data can transform industries and wrote my Bachelor's thesis on the evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs). From exploring Natural Language Processing (NLP) to building predictive models, I love uncovering hidden patterns and driving data-powered decisions.
