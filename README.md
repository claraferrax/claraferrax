Welcome to my GitHub profile! I’m Clara Maria Ferracini, a data scientist in training. I’m completing a Master’s in Big Data & Business Analytics at ESCP Business School. I am also a Business Intelligence Engineering intern at Amazon in Paris.

I like turning data into clear insights that people can use. I work across AI, machine learning, and predictive analytics. I enjoy building end to end projects, from data prep to modeling and evaluation.

I wrote my Bachelor’s thesis on how large language models evolve and how they affect higher education. I also explore NLP and anomaly detection, and I am currently working on thesis research that uses Projected Quantum Features (PQF) to study clustering and monitoring problems in supply chain settings.
